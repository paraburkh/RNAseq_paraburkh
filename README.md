# Description of the project


Nematodes like _Meloidogyne spp._, which causes the radical knot disease, are limiting factors in the production of tomato in tropical and subtropical areas. One of the most important species, from the phytopathological point of view, is _M. incognita._  Symptoms induced by _M. spp._ include the formation of radical galls that affect water and nutrient absorption, delay development of the plant, and significantly affect crop yield.

_Parabulkholderia tropica_ is a nitrogen-fixing bacteria regarded as a plant growth promoting bacterium. _P. tropica_ is a root endophytic bacterium, which appears to prime defense responses against endophytic pathogens. Technically, _P. tropica_ is a endophytic diazotrophic and phosphate-solubilizing bacteriun with demonstrated antagonistic activity against fungi, nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens. Nonetheless, the mechanisms whereby Paraburkholderia contributes to pathogen control and not well-understood but may include production of antibiotic substances and chelating agents like siderophores.

Interestingly, _Paraburkholderia spinosa_ has been applied on the foliage of banana plants and the permanence on the plant was more durable compared to with the bacterium as a soil drench. We therefore conducted a preliminary experiment to assess the efficacy of _P. tropica_ to counter _M. incognita_ colonizing the rhizosphere of tomato plants. Results showed that foliar application of _P. tropica_ allowed more vigorous growth of tomato plants inoculated with _M. incognita_.

Consequently, we designed an experiment including tomato control plants (TC), tomato plants inoculated with _P. tropica_ (TB), inoculated with _M. incognita_ or bith both  _P. tropica_ and _M. incognita_ (TBN). Three plants in each group were used for tissue collection, total RNA extraction, construction and sequencing of RNAseq NGS libraries.

The bioinformatics procedures applied to the analysis of sequencing data are described in the dedicated page 'bioinformaticsAnalysis'.
